## Poetry Forms

Understanding form provides structure and constraint for creativity.

### Traditional Forms

**Sonnet (14 lines):**

```
Shakespearean: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG (3 quatrains + couplet)
Petrarchan: ABBAABBA CDECDE (octave + sestet)
Iambic pentameter: 10 syllables per line, unstressed/stressed pattern
```

Example (Shakespearean):
```
When words fall short and silence fills the space,
And thoughts cascade like rain upon the earth,
I seek the truth within your whispered grace,
And find in poetry a second birth.

The meter guides my hand, the rhyme compels,
Each syllable a step toward what I mean,
Through structured verse, the heart's own story tells,
What prose alone has never fully seen.

Yet sonnets bind as much as they release,
The form constrains while meaning fights to soar,
In fourteen lines I labor for my peace,
And find that less has always offered more.

So let the rhyme and rhythm have their way,
For in their bounds, the truest words hold sway.
```

**Haiku (3 lines):**

```
Structure: 5-7-5 syllables
Focus: Nature, seasons, moment in time
Technique: Juxtaposition, cutting word (kireji in Japanese)
```

Example:
```
Autumn wind rising—
scattered leaves dance their last waltz
before winter's sleep
```

**Villanelle:**

```
19 lines: 5 tercets + 1 quatrain
Rhyme: ABA ABA ABA ABA ABA ABAA
Two refrains alternate, both appear in final quatrain
```

**Limerick:**

```
5 lines: AABBA
Rhythm: Anapestic (da-da-DUM)
Tone: Humorous, often irreverent
```

### Contemporary Forms

**Free Verse:**

```
No fixed meter, rhyme, or line length
Structure emerges from content, breath, emphasis
Uses: Enjambment, white space, varied line breaks
```

Example:
```
I want to write about the ordinary things—
the coffee cup,
           the morning light,
the way you fold the corner of the page
           before you close the book.

Not metaphors of love or grand declarations,
just the small geometries
of living with another person,
the architecture of shared mornings.
```

**Prose Poem:**

```
Poem written as prose paragraph
No line breaks, but maintains poetic compression
Uses imagery, rhythm, and heightened language
```

**List Poem:**

```
Series of items, observations, or images
Accumulation creates meaning
May or may not have repeated structure
```

## Core Techniques

### Imagery

Use concrete, sensory details:

```
# Weak - abstract
The day was sad and gloomy.

# Strong - concrete
Gray clouds pressed low,
muffling the morning birds.
Even the coffee tasted
like yesterday's rain.
```

**Technique:** Appeal to senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell)

### Metaphor and Simile

**Metaphor:** Direct equation (A is B)
```
Time is a thief stealing moments
Her words were daggers
```

**Simile:** Comparison using "like" or "as"
```
Silent as snow falling
Thoughts scattered like leaves
```

**Avoid clichés:**

| Overused | Fresh Alternative |
|----------|------------------|
| Heart of gold | Heart like bread—warm, essential, given freely |
| Time flies | Time slips through fingers like water through cupped hands |
| Light at the end of the tunnel | Dawn breaking through boarded windows |

### Sound Devices

**Alliteration:** Repeated initial consonants
```
Whispering winds weave through willows
```

**Assonance:** Repeated vowel sounds
```
The rain remains, a gray refrain
```

**Consonance:** Repeated consonant sounds (internal/end)
```
The silken sad uncertain rustling
```

**Onomatopoeia:** Words that sound like their meaning
```
The buzz, click, hum of the machinery
```

**Use sound to reinforce meaning:**

```
# Harsh sounds for harsh subject
Crack, scrape, shatter—
the brittle branch breaks

# Soft sounds for gentle subject  
Soft sighs and whispers
lull the sleeping child
```

### Line Breaks

**Enjambment:** Thought continues to next line
```
I wanted to tell you something
important, but the words
scattered like pigeons when you
looked at me that way.
```

**End-stopped:** Thought completes at line end
```
The day is done, the light is gone.
Night falls. The stars appear.
I stand alone beneath the moon.
```

**Break lines for emphasis:**

```
# Breaking before key word
I never thought I'd say
goodbye.

# Breaking for breath/pacing
The road goes on
and on
and on
into darkness.
```

## Revision Guidelines

**First draft goals:**
1. Get ideas on page
2. Follow form if using one
3. Don't self-edit while writing
4. Embrace imperfection

**Revision checklist:**

- [ ] Remove unnecessary words ("very", "really", "just")
- [ ] Replace abstract terms with concrete images
- [ ] Check for clichés—rewrite in fresh language
- [ ] Read aloud—listen for rhythm and awkward phrasing
- [ ] Verify form requirements (if applicable)
- [ ] Ensure every word earns its place
- [ ] Check opening line—does it hook the reader?
- [ ] Check ending—does it resonate or surprise?

**Line-by-line revision:**

```
# First draft
The beautiful sunset was really amazing to see
As the colors filled the evening sky

# Revised
Tangerine and copper streaked the clouds—
dusk painting the sky in rust and flame

Changes:
- Removed "beautiful" (show, don't tell)
- Removed "really" (filler word)
- Added specific colors (concrete details)
- Stronger verbs (painting vs. filled)
- Removed "to see" (implied by visual imagery)
```

## Theme and Meaning

**Start with specific detail, let meaning emerge:**

```
# Too direct (telling)
Loss is hard and makes us sad.

# Showing through detail
Your chair still faces the window.
I haven't moved it.
Sometimes I set two cups
on the counter, then remember—
only one.
```

**Allow ambiguity:**
- Poetry doesn't need to explain everything
- Multiple interpretations enrich the poem
- Trust readers to find their own meaning

**Earned emotion:**

```
# Unearned - declares feeling
I am so angry and upset!

# Earned - shows through action/image
I grip the steering wheel
until my knuckles white out.
The red light holds me hostage.
```

## Tone and Voice

**Consistent tone:**

| Tone | Characteristics | Word Choice |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| Formal | Elevated diction, traditional forms | Archaic words acceptable, complex syntax |
| Conversational | Natural speech patterns | Contractions, everyday language |
| Elegiac | Mournful, reflective | Measured pace, sorrowful imagery |
| Playful | Light, experimental | Wordplay, unexpected associations |
| Intimate | Confessional, personal | Direct address, vulnerability |

**Voice consistency check:**

```
# Inconsistent - shifts from formal to casual
Upon the verdant hills I wandered forth,
Then grabbed a coffee and checked my phone.

# Consistent - maintains formal tone
Upon the verdant hills I wandered forth,
And paused to rest beneath the ancient oak.

# Consistent - maintains casual tone
I walked the green hills for a while,
then stopped to grab some shade and text you back.
```

## Structure and White Space

**Stanza breaks:**
- Separate ideas or images
- Create pause for reader
- Shift in time, place, or perspective

**White space as element:**

```
The space between words


                                    matters


as much as the words themselves.
```

**Title guidelines:**
- Complements poem without repeating first line
- Can provide context or create tension
- "Untitled" is valid but often lazy
- Consider: What does the title add?

## Diction and Word Choice

**Precision over decoration:**

```
# Decorated but vague
The mellifluous symphony of avian creatures

# Precise and clear
The cardinal's song
```

**Active verbs:**

| Weak/Passive | Strong/Active |
|--------------|---------------|
| was walking | strode, wandered, trudged |
| was bright | blazed, glowed, shimmered |
| went down | sank, plummeted, descended |

**Avoid:**
- Thesaurus words (unless you know them well)
- Archaic language for effect ("thou", "hither") without reason
- Filler words ("very", "really", "quite", "just")
- Unnecessary articles (the, a, an) in poetic compression

## Revision Process

**Multiple passes:**

1. **Content:** Does it say what you want?
2. **Sound:** Read aloud, listen for music
3. **Image:** Are descriptions concrete and vivid?
4. **Form:** Does structure serve the poem?
5. **Words:** Can any be cut or improved?
6. **Ending:** Does it earn its final line?

**Time between drafts:**
- Wait at least 24 hours before revising
- Distance reveals problems invisible during writing
- Read with fresh eyes

**Testing the poem:**
- Read aloud multiple times
- Ask: Would I stop to read this in a magazine?
- Remove yourself from it—does it work independently?
- Check: Is any line there only for rhyme or meter?

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Use clichés ("rose-colored glasses") | Create fresh comparisons |
| Force rhyme at expense of meaning | Let meaning guide form |
| Tell emotions directly ("I am sad") | Show through image and detail |
| Use "poetic" language unnaturally | Write with authentic voice |
| Ignore line breaks (write as prose) | Use line breaks for emphasis and rhythm |
| Over-explain or moralize | Trust reader to find meaning |
| Add words just to fill meter | Cut to essentials, adjust meter |
| Use abstractions exclusively | Ground in concrete sensory detail |
| Default to past tense narration | Consider present tense for immediacy |
| Write about "poetry" or "writing" | Write about the world beyond writing |
| Mix metaphors ("grasping at straws of hope") | Maintain consistent imagery |
| Rely on archaic language ("thee", "thou") | Use contemporary language unless justified |

## Quick Reference

| Aspect | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| Opening line | Hook reader with image or question |
| Line breaks | For emphasis, breath, or meaning |
| Imagery | Concrete, sensory details |
| Revision | Multiple passes with time between |
| Clichés | Find fresh alternatives |
| Emotion | Show through detail, don't declare |
| Diction | Precise words over decorative ones |
| Sound | Read aloud to check rhythm |
| Ending | Resonate or surprise, don't explain |
| Form | Constraint can spark creativity |

## When Writing Poetry

1. Start with concrete image or specific moment
2. Choose form (or free verse) before writing
3. First draft without self-editing
4. Read aloud after completing draft
5. Wait 24 hours before revising
6. Revise for imagery, sound, and compression
7. Remove unnecessary words ruthlessly
8. Verify form requirements if using traditional structure
9. Test the ending—does it earn the poem?
10. Read aloud one final time before considering complete

## Form Selection Guide

Choose form based on content and intent:

| Form | Best For | Avoid For |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Sonnet | Love, argument, meditation | Quick impressions, simple observations |
| Haiku | Nature, single moment | Complex narratives, abstract concepts |
| Free verse | Modern subjects, natural speech | When constraint would enhance meaning |
| Villanelle | Obsession, repetition, spiraling thought | Linear narratives, variety of ideas |
| Prose poem | Narrative, sustained imagery | When breath/pacing needs line control |
| List poem | Accumulation, cataloging, observation | When coherent argument is needed |

Poetry thrives on constraint and precision. Every word must earn its place.
