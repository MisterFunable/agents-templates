Autumn Haiku Collection
-----------------------

1.
Autumn wind rising—
scattered leaves dance their last waltz
before winter's sleep

2.
Frost on the window
traces maps to nowhere known—
morning's brief secret

3.
The last apple falls
without witness or applause—
just the earth's embrace

4.
Migration southward—
the V-formation writes goodbye
across empty sky

5.
Rake against the stones—
the sound of seasons changing
one scrape at a time

---

Form: Haiku (5-7-5 syllables)

Techniques demonstrated:
- Nature focus in each poem
- Seasonal references (autumn/winter imagery)
- Concrete sensory details (frost traces, rake sound, leaves dance)
- Juxtaposition (contrasting images in each line)
- Present tense for immediacy
- Single moment captured in each haiku
- Cutting word creating pause/shift (— mark)
- No abstraction or direct emotion statement
