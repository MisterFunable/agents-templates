Morning Sonnet
--------------

When dawn arrives with muted copper glow,
And coffee steams in vapor-written words,
I watch the city wake, both fast and slow,
The morning song of distant traffic herds.

The paper rustles like a winter branch,
Your chair sits empty by the kitchen light,
I fold the page and take my daily chance
To face another ordinary sight.

But ordinary holds its own disguise—
The way the steam dissolves against the air,
The truth that hides in mundane goodbyes,
The weight of all the moments that we share.

So let me write what morning always knew:
That simple things contain what's most true.
