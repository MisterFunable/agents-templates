The Ordinary Things
-------------------

I want to write about the ordinary things—
the coffee cup,
           the morning light,
the way you fold the corner of the page
           before you close the book.

Not metaphors of love or grand declarations,
just the small geometries
of living with another person,
the architecture of shared mornings.

How you always leave
           two sugars in my cup
           without asking,
how I know the sound
           of your key in the lock
           from three rooms away.

These are the poems
           no one writes—
the syntax of daily life,
the grammar of
           being together
           without trying.

I could write about passion,
about the storm and thunder
           of new love,
but I'd rather write about
           the settled weather,
the steady rain
           that makes things grow.
