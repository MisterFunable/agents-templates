Revision Example: "Winter Evening"
====================================

FIRST DRAFT (with problems marked)
-----------------------------------

The beautiful sunset was really amazing to see              [cliché, filler words]
As the colors filled the evening sky                        [abstract "colors"]
The cold winter wind was blowing through the trees          [telling, passive]
And made a very sad and lonely sound                        [declaring emotion]
I felt really sad as I walked alone                         [telling, filler]
Down the path that we used to walk together                 [cliché phrase]
Everything reminded me of you                               [too abstract]
And I missed you so much it hurt                            [telling emotion directly]


REVISED VERSION
---------------

Winter Evening

Tangerine and copper streaked the clouds—
dusk painting the sky in rust and flame.

Wind through bare branches,
that high whistle of winter
threading through empty nests.

I walked our path alone,
your absence loud as the crack
of ice beneath my boots.

Your coffee cup still sits
beside the door. I saw it there
this morning. Set it back.
